# Burn Import

The `burn-import` crate enables seamless integration of pre-trained models from popular machine
learning frameworks into the Burn ecosystem. This functionality allows you to leverage existing
models while benefiting from Burn's performance optimizations and native Rust integration.

## Supported Import Formats

Burn currently supports three primary model import formats, each serving different use cases:

| Format                                                                              | Description                               | Use Case                                                                                               |
